# Tick call

The easiest way to understand how Deriv API works is to try our Tick call.

A tick is a measure of minimum upward or downward movement in the price of a trading commodity. We subscribe to the ticks functionality from the Deriv API websocket, which will return new tick data every second. As an example you could create an interactive tick graph with this data.

Try the following example. You don't have to log into the Deriv account for this.
