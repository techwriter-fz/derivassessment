  <summary>**Step 3:** Create a Deriv application</summary>

To create a Deriv application, you need to provide a name for your application and a redirect URI. The redirect URI is the URL that the user will be redirected to after they have authorised your application to access their Deriv account.

For more information, [see Create a Deriv Application](./guides/createderivapp.md)

  <summary>**Step 4:** Authorise your application</summary>

Once you've created your API application, authorise it to access your Deriv account. This involves logging into your Deriv account and granting permission for your application to access your account data.

For more information, [see Authenticate and authorise the API](./guides/apiauthentication.md)

  <summary>**Step 5:** Make API requests</summary>

Once your application is authorised, you can start making API requests.

You can use the API to retrieve information about your account, place trades, manage orders, and perform other trading-related tasks.
