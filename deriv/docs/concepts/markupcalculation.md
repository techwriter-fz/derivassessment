# Markup calculation

Increase your earnings by charging markups on each contract purchased through the trading app you've created with the Deriv API. The markup is defined by you and can be up to 3%.

Below is an example of how the markup is calculated.

To get a payout of **2.00 USD**:

* Client stake without markup = **1.07 USD**

With the markup (e.g. 2%), a client pays:

* Client's stake with the markup = Stake + (payout x markup)
* Client's stake with the markup = 1.07 USD + (2 USD x 2%) = **1.11 USD**
